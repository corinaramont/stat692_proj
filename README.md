Data: US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS) created the Food Access Research Atlas in order to show an overview of food access indicators for low-income and other census tracts using different measures of supermarket accessibility; provide food access data for populations within census tracts; and census-tract-level data on food access that can be downloaded for community planning or research purposes. The data is updated approximately every five years since 2006.
