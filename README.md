## Background
This project is completed as part of a 2024 capstone for the MS in Statistics program at Texas A&M University. 

## Data

The data is part of the Korea Multicenter Cancer Cohort project which focuses on understanding and learning the relationships between certain factors (e.g., lifestyle and
environmental) with cancer occurrence. The CRC dataset is a compilation of 14570 patients who have had a history of CRC or not. The patients were asked questions regarding various topics such as their lifestyle (e.g., alcohol consumption history, amount of exercise during a week), clinical information (e.g., history of polyps found, diabetes mellitus presence) and others (e.g., education level).


## Project Description
The aim of this project is to understand the different factors that influence the presence of CRC in Korean patients and their effects by implementing random forest. We used the dataset from the
Korea Multicenter Cancer Cohort project and implemented random forest. After tuning our model and using it on our testing data, we obtained an accuracy of 79%. Our final analyses included 11925 patients and 13 factors of interest. The three most important variables identified are average on study, fasting glucose levels, and the area of origin. The model showed commonly supported findings except for the lack of influence from history of colorectal polyps. It is likely the model had a difficult time differentiating that particular factor between the two patient groups. The hopes of this project is to beneficially impact people by raising awareness of CRC as a global public health issue and encourage people to monitor their health. One possibility for future research is to look into if there are diet differences between the areas of origin.
